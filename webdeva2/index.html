			<h2>History & Origins of Volleyball</h2>

			<p>In 1895, William G. Morgan, an instructor at the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) Holyoke, Massachusetts, decided blend elements of basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball to create a game. So, he borrowed. From basketball, he took the ball. From tennis the net. From handball, the use of hands and the ability to play off the walls and over hangs. And, from, he took the concept of innings.</p>

			<p>Morgan introduced the sport (called mintonette, the original name of volleyball) at the YMCA Physical Director's Conference a year later at Springfield College, Massachusetts. Though it was incomplete with no fixed rules and a format to follow, the sport did enough to win over the delegation and soon became a part of YMCA's wide network throughout the USA with a new name - volley ball (initially it was termed as two words). Volleyball was officially selected to spell as a single word in 1952.</p>
